IDEA:
	the player is a bacterium (or just generally a microbe that divides - maybe offer different choices?)
	player consumes nutrients
	uses nutrients to divide
	nutrient deposits can last for a long time and once part of the colony has started to eat it, the player doesn't need to interact with it for it to continue eating
		this continues even if the game is not being played
	player grows as they eat and can choose branches towards more food to "build" using nutrients
	different branches have different amounts of nutrient piles
	optional ads can give you more nutrients
	
LOGIC:
	tilemap level showing vague, liquidy environments that vary across levels
	after player reaches a certain size, level is completed
	button-based controls:
		nutrient deposit
