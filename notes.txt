IDEA:
	the player is a bacterium (or just generally a microbe that divides - maybe offer different choices?)
	player consumes nutrients
	uses nutrients to divide
	nutrient deposits can last for a long time and once part of the colony has started to eat it, the player doesn't need to interact with it for it to continue eating
		this continues even if the game is not being played
	player grows as they eat and can choose branches towards more food to "build" using nutrients
	different branches have different amounts of nutrient piles
	optional ads can give you more nutrients
	
	NEW:
		cozy atomsphere but vaguely post-apocalyptic world in a strictly anti-capitalist system
		the player (to keep it cozy, they should be an animal or magical creature - maybe as couple so you can always have two actions going?) sifts through trash basically and finds various parts
		the parts are then used to repair devices
		EX:
			player begins with a wrench and a windmill that needs a bolt tightened in a run down old house
			pile of rubbage near the windmill has scrap metal
			poking around in the house reveals an old machine shop, and the player can manually run it to turn the scrap metal into bolts
			use the bolts to fix fix the windmill, allows them to generate electricity
			electricity lets the player use the machine tools and it only takes time, not clicks
			some days aren't very windy
			cleaning through the old house yeilds more scrap metal and stuff and the player finds a metal shop
			can smelt metal objects and shape them (skill builds here, maybe this is a different kind of mini game)
			smelted metal can be used as stock in the machine tools
			surplus materials can be traded with NPCs for other materials, but there's no market and sometimes people just owe each other, and sometimes they decide to forget the debt
			NPCs will have stuff they want fixed too
				each level is more or less about helping some person, usually for no reward
GRAPHICS
	cozy pixel art
	16x32 sprite is too small, 32x64 sprites and 32x32 items feels nice but is still a bit small really
		the problem with these larger sizes is that each asset will take a long time to make - I want to produce this game more quickly and so if 16x32 is too small, maybe try 24x24 or make the game canvas smaller
		same for the tiles - 32x32 can look great but is probably too big and too detailed for my goal with this project
		16x16 sprites and items with 16x16 tiles
		currently using nanner 32 palette
			
	
LOGIC:
	tilemap level showing vague, liquidy environments that vary across levels
	after player reaches a certain size, level is completed
	button-based controls:
		nutrient deposit
